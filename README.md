This is my solution for questions at [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com).

## Setup

To run this project, you need to install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (>=v17) and an editor/IDE such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/download/).

```bash
# Run in the root folder
go mod tidy
go run main.go [-option]
```
